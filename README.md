_The International Chronostratigraphic Chart from International Commission on Stratigraphy, in computer readable formats._

Computer-readable versions of the [The International Chronostratigraphic Chart](http://www.stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2018-08.jpg). I couldn't find this when I serached, so I made a version for you. 

All rights belong to [International Commission on Stratigraphy](http://www.stratigraphy.org)

Please report any typos or suggest improvements, e.g. another way to represent the [American subperiods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippian_(geology)). I might implement the colour scheme as well in future.
