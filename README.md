Computer-readable versions of the [The International Chronostratigraphic Chart](http://www.stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2018-08.jpg). 

All rights belong to [International Commission on Stratigraphy](http://www.stratigraphy.org)

Please report any typos or suggest improvements, e.g. representation of the American subperiods. I might implement the colour scheme as well next.
